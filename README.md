## What is Streamusic?

Streamusic, pronounced as Stream-music, utilizes AI to create music. Predictions are made using A10G GPUs to generate the audio tracks. This ensures that the music provided is unique and non-copyrighted.

## Features

- No need to utilize your GPU power for generating the music.
- No risk of copyright strikes since the music is non-copyrighted.

However, due to the high number of requests the site receives, there may be occasional lag spikes in the audio.

## Setup Guide

Note: The public servers are not quick at all. I highly recommend using the private hosting instead.
